# Building a static website

## Goals
Expose students to a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript site. This will act as a first measure for each student's comfort level with the various technologies used in the browser.

## Background
A new coffeeshop has opened in town. All they do is serve the normal type of coffee drinks. They simply want to get an Internet presence up and running so people know that they are in business and begin coming by the coffee shop. You job is to design and build a one page, static website for them.

## What they need on the page

1. Name of the coffee shop as the title of the page
1. Name of the coffee shop in a header
1. Two paragraphs of welcome text display on the page
1. A list of 5 coffee drinks with a header. These drinks are not ordered in any way.
1. The address of the coffee shop in the footer
1. A mail to link that allows people to contact the coffeeshop in the footer
1. A picture of the coffee shop to show people how cool it is. This picture should be placed in the images directory.

## How they want it to look


## Deployment
Your final site should be deployed to Heroku for story acceptance by the coffee shop owner (played by the instructors). All of the Tracker stories for this assignment can be found in your working Tracker project. They should be addressed in the order found in your Tracker project.
